## 📊 Project Overview
The goal of this project is to:
- Load and explore housing data
- Clean and preprocess features
- Train and evaluate regression models (Linear, Polynomial, Ridge)
- Compare model performance using R² scores

---

## 📂 Dataset
- **Source:** [King County House Sales Dataset](https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBMDeveloperSkillsNetwork-DA0101EN-SkillsNetwork/labs/FinalModule_Coursera/data/kc_house_data_NaN.csv)
- **Features:** House attributes like `sqft_living`, `bedrooms`, `bathrooms`, etc.
- **Target:** `price`
