This project effectively demonstrates a complete machine learning workflow for predicting house prices. Through a series of steps including data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and model building, we've identified key features that influence a home's value and built several predictive models.

The analysis highlights that while a simple linear regression model provides a decent baseline, incorporating a wider range of features significantly improves predictive accuracy. The most notable performance gain came from increasing model complexity using polynomial features and Ridge Regression. This approach, which accounted for non-linear relationships in the data and helped prevent overfitting, produced the best results with an R-squared score of 0.75.

This suggests that for this specific dataset, the relationship between features and price is more complex than a simple linear one. The final model, a combination of polynomial features and Ridge Regression, is the most robust and accurate predictor of house prices within this analysis.
